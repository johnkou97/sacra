# Scripts and notebooks for analyzing gravitational waves from Binary Neutron Star Mergers.

## Data taken from [SACRA](http://www2.yukawa.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~nr_kyoto/SACRA_PUB/catalog.html) Gravitational Waveform Data Bank

## Producing Fourier transformations and spectrograms of postmerger phase

### The project contains the following files:
- `download_extract.py`: script for downloading and organizing the data.
- `M_R.ipynb`: creates M-R plots for all the BNS mergers and the different EOS.
- `Plots.ipynb`: notebook that creates the fourier tranformation plots and the spectrograms.
- `Plots.py`: script that creates the fourier tranformation plots and the spectrograms.
- `tid_def/`: folder containing all the information about the EOS of the different binary neutron stars. The analysis was done using [pyTOVpp](https://github.com/johnkou97/pyTOVpp) 
- `results/`: folder containing all the different plots that were created using the scripts and notebooks
- `old/`: folder containing old resutls
